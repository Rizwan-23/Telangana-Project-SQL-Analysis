/* [Question-6]: List the top and bottom 5 districts based on 'population to tourist footfall ratio'*

 @ RESEARCH:-

 # Additional data is taken from wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_districts_of_Telangana

 # Now, to obtain 2019 and 2025 residents data I simply found CAGR with the current year i.e, 2023

 # Population data 2023 which is '38090000' is taken from this link:https://www.findeasy.in/population-of-telangana/ 
 
 # Population_2011(IV) = 34998289, Population_2023(FV) = 38090000, Growth => FV-IV = 38090000-34998289 = 3091711
   
   Growth Rate=> (Growth/IV)*100 = (3091711/34998289)*100 = 9% 

   Yearly Growth Rate => (0.09/11)*100 = 0.8%  [ time interval between 2023 and 2011 = 11 years ]

   Yearly Growth => Population_2011 * Yearly Growth Rate  = 34998289*0.008 = 279986

   Let's assume it is growing by 0.8% 

   Population (given_year) => Population_2011 + (yearly growth)* (no. of years gap)

   So, Population_2019 => Population_2011 + (Population_2011 * 0.008) * 8 = 37238179

   Similarly, Population_2025 => Population_2011 + (Population_2011 * 0.008) * 14 = 38918093
